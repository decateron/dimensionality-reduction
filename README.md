# Dimensionality reduction
The goal of the project is to compare 5 dimensionality reduction algorithms in different situations and understand in which cases which algorithms are the best.

## Algorithms:
### [Randomized PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html#principal-component-analysis-pca), [Kernel Approximation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/kernel_approximation.html), [Isomap](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/manifold.html#isomap), [Spectral Embedding](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/manifold.html#spectral-embedding), [LLE](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/manifold.html#locally-linear-embedding)
